Compare2ImagesPancreas="""I am sending you 2 images, Image 1 and Image 2. Both images are frontal projections of the same CT scan. They are not CT slices, they have transparency, showing through the entire body. They look like AP X-rays.
A red shape (overlay) over the images demarks the pancreas, but they may not be accurate. The overlays in Image 1 and Image 2 are different. 
Evaluate each image individually, carefully compare them and conclude which overlay better represents the pancreas, the one in Image 1 or in Image 2. 
Consider the following anatomical information:
a) Shape: The pancreas is an elongated organ with a tadpole-like shape. The pancreas head is its thickest part and points to the left side of the image, which is the right side of the body because the image is oriented like an AP X-ray. The other side of the pancreas is thin.
b) Position: The pancreas is located in the upper abdomen, behind the stomach and near the bottom of the rib cage. The organ is mostly horizontal, but may be slightly curved and its head usually sits lower than its tail.
C) Smoothness: The pancreas is a single smooth shape and it does not have very sharp edges."""

Evaluate each image individually, carefully compare them, and conclude which overlay better represents the spleen, the one in Image 1 or in Image 2.
Consider the following anatomical information:
a) Shape: The spleen red overlay should resemble an oval or crescent, with smooth and continuous curves. An irregular or jagged outline is likely incorrect, even if the overlay appears smaller.
b) Completeness: The spleen red overlay must cover the entire spleen. Any missing portions, especially in the upper or lateral aspects, indicate an incomplete and thus incorrect overlay.
c) Unity: The spleen red overlay must be a single, continuous structure. Multiple structures or disconnected sections are major errors.
d) Location: The spleen red overlay should be located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen (right side of the image, which is oriented like an AP X-ray), slightly under the ribs and adjacent to the stomach and left kidney, just below the diaphragm. 
e) Size: The spleen red overlay may vary in size, depending on anatomical factors such as splenic enlargement. A larger spleen that still maintains the correct shape and location should not be considered incorrect solely due to size. Small overlays with irregular or jagged shapes are more likely to be incorrect.
f) Alignment: The overlay should follow the curvature of the ribs without extending too far toward the midline (spine) or downwards into the pelvic area.
g) Disease-related changes: If the spleen appears enlarged in one of the images, consider that this could be a result of an underlying medical condition. Enlarged spleens that maintain correct shape, smoothness, and continuity are still considered correct."""

"Q3- The %(organ)s region in the images should be marked in red, using an overlay. However, the red overlays may correctly or incorrectly mark the %(organ)s. The letters R (blue) and L (green) inside the images represent the right and left sides of the human body. Compare overlay 1 (shown in images 1 and 2) to overlay 2 (shown in images 3 and 4) and tell me which one is a better overlay for the %(organ)s.\n")
DescribeLiver=("When evaluating and comparing the overlays, consider the following anatomical information:\n"
"a) The liver is a large organ, with triangular or wedge-like shape.\n"
"b) The liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen (right is indicated with a blue R in the figures), just below the diaphragm. It spans across the midline, partially extending into the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. It spans across the midline, partially extending into the left upper quadrant. Looking at the bones images 1 and 3, you can easily identify if the liver should appear in the images or not. The liver is not in the pelvis.\n"
"c) The liver is a single structure. \n"
"d) The liver position is primarily under the rib cage.\n"
"e) If the CT scan does not include the liver region (for example, a scan showing just the pelvis), the correct overlay is actually the one showing no red region (or as little as possible).\n")
SinglePromptSepImages=("The images I am sending are frontal projections of one CT scan. They are not CT slices, instead, they have transparency and let you see through the entire human body, like an X-ray does. In all images, a blue R indicates the right side of the human body, and a green L indicates the left side. All 3 images are projections of the same 3D CT scan. \n"
"Image 1: frontal projection of the CT scan using a wide window (2000 UI) for better bone visualization, you can use this image to better understand which body region the CT scan encompasses.\n"
"Image 2: frontal projection of a CT scan using a narrow window (400 UI) for better organ visualization. The image is also superposed with %(organ)s overlay 1, in red.\n"
"Image 3: the same frontal projection of a CT scan as image 1 and 2, but superposed with %(organ)s overlay 2.\n"
"Answer the following questions in a stepwise manner:\n"
"Q1- Look carefully, tell me which body region the CT scan represents and where its limits are. Provide a detailed list of all organs usually contained in this region.\n"
"Q2- Based on your answer to question Q1, should the %(organ)s be present in this image? Answer with just ‘yes’ or ‘no’.. If your answer is ‘no’, fill the following template, substituting  _ by Yes or No, and add it to the end of your answer:\n"
"\n"
"Q2 = _\n"
"\n"
"- If your answer to Q2 is ‘yes’, continue to question 3 (below). \n"
"- If your answer to Q2 is ‘no’, ignore Q3 and tell me which overlay has smallest amount of red color. Then, fill the template substituting _ by 1 or 2 (do not fill the template if your answer to Q2 is yes): \n"
